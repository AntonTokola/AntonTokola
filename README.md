👋 Hi, I’m @AntonTokola
I'm a dedicated self-taught backend developer from Finland with a strong focus on Microsoft technologies, especially C# and .NET. 
In my current role at Forcit Consulting Oy, I've independently developed several internal tools that have improved daily operations, despite not working officially as a developer.
I'm passionate about building practical solutions and continuously expanding my skills. My main interests lie in backend development, cloud services (Azure), and fullstack projects using .NET and React.

🧠 Constantly learning, especially in the areas of .NET backend development, JavaScript/React frontend, and Azure-based deployments.
