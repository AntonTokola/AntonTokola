# 👋 Hi, I’m @AntonTokola

I'm a **dedicated self-taught backend developer** from Finland with a strong focus on **Microsoft technologies**, especially **C# and .NET**.  
In my current role at **Forcit Consulting Oy**, I've independently developed several internal tools that have improved daily operations — despite not working officially as a developer.  

I'm passionate about building practical solutions and continuously expanding my skills. My main interests lie in **backend development**, **cloud services (Azure)**, and **fullstack projects** using **.NET and React**.
